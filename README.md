# Breast_Cancer_Detection
Breast cancer detection by Python. Deep learning using Keras and U-NET algorithm.

## what is the U-NET algorithm ?
This algorithm mostly used for "Medical Image" semantic segmentation.
The UNET was developed by Olaf Ronneberger et al.

### What pictures i used?
I used breast tissue pictures from https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/  
It is about 58 pictures. I used 56 for training and 2 for testing my model.
All of the pictures had Mask layer(picture) that showed the cancer cells.
